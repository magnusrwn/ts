# This repo is all saved code for learning ts.

## Currently it is 12/07/2025 --- I aim to be competent in ts by 01/09/2025 latest

For context, I am somewhat-competent in intermediate js, and I can grasp most pytohn concepts.

I aim to learn this as quickly as possible, and then move on to react as quick as possible, to build a mini site(s), and to be able to work on
other projects more competently.
